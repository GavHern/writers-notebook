      <strong>Describe how you completed this assignment.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each week, I took note of 6 quotes from the assigned reading and put
          them in my writer's notebook. I then accompanied them with a title
          which describes the treasure they provided and a brief description in
          my own words to give context to the quote.
        </li>
        <li>
          I created a website using TypeScript, SvelteJS, and TailwindCSS as a
          home for all of my discoveries, and made a layout with 6 headings for
          each category, and a masonry-style grid layout for all of the
          different tips I'd gathered.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>
        What did you like the best / least about this project? Why?
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I loved having freedom in the creative direction! I enjoy web
          development and, while this was ambitious, I loved being able to find
          an intersection between it and this writing class.
        </li>
        <li>
          There isn't much I didn't like about this project. I suppose some of
          the reading assignments were difficult to get through, but it was
          ultimately an enjoyable sidequest for the quarter.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>
        What challenges did you face as you worked on this project? How did you
        overcome those challenges?
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For the assignment, the main challenge I faced was figuring out how to
          organize my writer's notebook. I didn't want to blindly collect quotes
          to then sort out at the end of the quarter, so I tried to predict the
          categories I would end up needing pretty early on. They ended up being
          good choices, but it was a challenge to make that decision without
          knowing how it would turn out.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also faced some technical challenges, like a bug in Google Chrome
          that broke many of my animations on week 10. Because of things like
          this, I made the <a href="/raw">raw data</a> version of the website which
          is a lot more minimal and less prone to breaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was also difficult to arrange my work in a coding context rather
          than a Google Doc, since it made it harder to run through
          spellchecking and Grammarly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

        time, what would you do to improve this project?</strong

      <ul>
        <li>
          I put a lot of work into this writer's notebook, and I think I've gone
          above and beyond with this assignment. At the start of the quarter, I
          looked at the list of example writer's notebooks and set a goal to try
          to make the list for future classes, which is what motivated me to
          spend a lot of time making it visually appealing and easy to digest.
        </li>
        <li>
          I would hope to earn an A on this assignment as a product of my hard
          work to make it comprehensive and visually appealing. ðŸ˜Š

      <strong>Will you use this Writer's Notebook in the future? How?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In my future writing, I plan on referring back to my writer's notebook
          and the tips I've collected over the quarter. This class has reshaped
          a lot of my previous assumptions about writing essays, and I've gained
          a lot of new strategies that have been helpful to grow as a writer.
          I've also shown my writer's notebook to some friends for feedback, and
          they've said they would genuinely use it while writing an essay!
